Messing around with some app development to learn more and become more proficient

## NFL ##
A friend of mine who is an NFL scout and analyst asked how I'd rank NFL head coaches. So I decided to write an app where I could do this very easily and with visuals rather than manually
manipulating through Excel or other software. 

## File Extensions ##
I ran into some projects in the past that had several dozen or 100s of files that needed file extensions converted to another format in order for other software to utilize the files and I didn't want to convert them manually. I forgot to upload this until now.
